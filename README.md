## Introduction

Create your own Fintech app in minutes using **[Crossmint](https://crossmint.com)** wallets and onramp.

**Key features**

- Login with email or social media
- Automatically create non-custodial wallets for your users
- Top up with USDC using a credit or debit card
- Transfer USDC to another wallet or email address
- View your wallet activity
- Withdraw USDC to your bank account
- Support for +40 chains (Solana, EVM, etc)
- Leverage more than +200 onchain tools integrating [GOAT](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat)

**New: Yield Integration**

- Earn yield on your USDC through DeFi protocols (Aave, Morpho, Compound)
- Powered by [Yield.xyz](https://yield.xyz) - the unified yield infrastructure for Web3
- The wallets in this demo use testnet tokens to interact with mainnet yield protocols. Testnet deposits won't actually earn yield — this is for demonstration purposes only.

**New: Autonomous Yield Agent (EIP-7702)**

The LiqX Agent automatically rebalances user funds across DeFi protocols to maximize yield using EIP-7702 delegation.

### How It Works

1. **One-Time Authorization**: Users authorize EIP-7702 delegation through a simple UI interaction
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Agent monitors yield opportunities across protocols every 5 minutes
3. **Smart Rebalancing**: When APY improvement exceeds your threshold, the agent rebalances automatically
4. **Gasless Transactions**: All transactions are executed via Gelato Relay with no gas fees to users
5. **Full Control**: Users can enable/disable auto-optimize or revoke authorization anytime

### Features

- ✅ **Fully Autonomous**: No manual intervention required once enabled
- ✅ **User-Controlled**: Set custom APY thresholds and disable anytime
- ✅ **Gasless**: Zero transaction fees for users
- ✅ **Transparent**: View all agent actions in real-time dashboard
- ✅ **Safe**: Built on EIP-7702 with user authorization required

### Agent Dashboard

Track your agent's performance:
- Total rebalances executed
- Success rate and APY improvements
- Estimated yearly gains
- Complete activity timeline with transaction details

### Security

- Agent operates only with explicit user authorization (EIP-7702)
- Authorization can be revoked at any time
- All transactions are simulated before execution
- Rate limits and safety checks prevent excessive operations

### For Developers

- Architecture overview and system design
- Deployment instructions and configuration
- Monitoring and troubleshooting guides
- Database queries and performance optimization

## Deploy

Easily deploy the template to Vercel with the button below. You will need to set the required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCrossmint%2Ffintech-starter-app&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_CLIENT_API_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID,NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_MINT)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crossmint/fintech-starter-app.git && cd fintech-starter-app
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. Set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

4. Login to the <a href="https://staging.crossmint.com/console" target="_blank">Crossmint staging console</a> and get the client API key from the <a href="https://staging.crossmint.com/console/overview" target="_blank">overview page</a>:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_CLIENT_API_KEY=your_client_side_API_key
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Using another chain

To use another chain, you'll need to:

1. Update the chain environment variable to the chain you want to use.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=solana
```

2. Update the USDC locator to the USDC of the chain you want to use.

```env
# For solana 4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_MINT=your_USDC_mint
```

## Using in production

This starter app is designed for rapid prototyping and testing in a staging environment. To move to production you'll need to:

1. Login to the [Crossmint production console](https://www.crossmint.com/console) and [create a client side API key](https://www.crossmint.com/console/projects/apiKeys) with the following scopes: `users.create`, `users.read`, `wallets.read`, `wallets.create`, `wallets:transactions.create`, `wallets:transactions.sign`, `wallets:transactions.read`, `wallets:balance.read`, `wallets.fund`.
2. Update the chain environment variable to a mainnet chain.
   - **Note ⚠️**: Non custodial signers for solana are not available in production yet since they are undergoing a security audit. Reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/crossmintdevs) to be the first to know when they are available.
3. Update the USDC locator to the USDC of the mainnet chain you want to use.
4. Customize your email template for login and signup in the [Crossmint console](https://www.crossmint.com/console) under the Settings tab in the Branding section.
5. For using onramp in production reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/fintechstarterapp).

### Enabling Withdrawals

Withdrawals are powered by [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/en-es/developer-platform) and only work in production. For enabling withdrawals you'll need to:

1. [Create a Coinbase developer account](https://www.coinbase.com/en-es/developer-platform)
2. Create a Server API Key
3. Add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_COINBASE_APP_ID`, `COINBASE_API_KEY_ID`, and `API_KEY_SECRET` to the `.env` file.
4. In the [Onramp configuration](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onramp) add your domain to the domain allowlist
